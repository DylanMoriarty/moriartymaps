    <p>Hello!</p>

    <p>Welcome to a work in progress website. Pardon the sawdust, amazed you found it in this state. Nice!</p>

    <p>Dylan is a map makin' Midwestern with a knack for whimsy and creative storytelling. Professionally he's a graphics reporter and cartographer at the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/dylan-moriarty/">Washington Post</a> where he maintains disaster weather trackers, makes breaking news visuals, and manages to fit a watercolor or two in every so often.</p>
                
    <p>Outside of the news, he strives to make artful maps that convey more than just <i>where</i> something is. Using the marginalia and frames to better evoke and reveal details about the subject and story at hand.</p>

    <p></p>

    <p>His work has been recognized by the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/pr/2022/03/18/overseas-press-club-awards-recognize-washington-post-five-categories/" target="_blank">Overseas Press Club</a>, Society of News Design, some other organizations, but most importantly by his sister who has a wall in her guest bedroom dedicated to it. Thanks L!</p>
